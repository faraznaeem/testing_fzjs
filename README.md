# Weekend Challenge

## Fizzbuzz.js

  

In this challenge we are revisiting the fizzbuzz kata, but in JS!

  

We are also bringing back the training wheel

testing package to write test to our code.

As the final part of the challenge you need to deploy your website using github pages.

  

**What we are expecting to see in your implementation:**

  

- A deployed website with some styling

- All test are going green

- Good and readable commits with commits after every test going green or when you have added implementation code

- Usage of branches

- A PR towards your own master branch

- Answers to the questions in the README

  
  

### Setup

  

1. Create a folder called:

```bash

$ mkdir fizzbuzz_js_yourname

```

  

2. Move into that folder and initialize git:

```bash

$ git init

```

  
  
  

3. Initialize npm with:

  

```bash

$ npm init

```

  

4. Create a README

  

5. Create a repo on GitHub and connect it to your local machine.

  

6. Create and switch to a new branch called `development`,

this will be the branch that you are going to work from.

  

7. Go over to the training wheels [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/e2e_training_wheels)

and follow the instructions to install it. This is the same package that we used in the BMI-challenge.

  

**Make sure that you create a `.gitignore` and add `node_modules` before you commit**

  

8. We are going to unit test so we need a spec folder

create a `spec` folder and a `spec.helper.js`

  

```

$ mkdir spec

$ touch spec/spec.helper.js

```

Add the following code to the `spec.helper.js` (in the top of the file)

  

```js
const  fs = require('fs');
const  chai = require('chai');
global.expect = chai.expect;

let  fizzBuzz = fs.readFileSync('./src/js/fizz-buzz.js');
eval( fizzBuzz + `\nexports.FizzBuzz = FizzBuzz;`)
```

---

  

***Question 1*. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain what the following lines of code do**

```js
let  fizzBuzz = fs.readFileSync('./src/js/fizz-buzz.js');
eval( fizzBuzz + `\nexports.FizzBuzz = FizzBuzz;`)
```

---

  

We are now done with the setup lets move to the next part.

  

------

  

## Unit testing

  

1. Create a file called `fizz-buzz.spec.js`

```bash
$ touch spec/fizz-buzz.spec.js
```

Add  
```js
const { FizzBuzz } =  require('./spec.helper')
```
to the top of the `fizz-buzz.spec.js`

Add also your `describe` block to the same file
```js
describe('Fizz Buzz', () => {
	let fizzBuzz = new FizzBuzz
})
```

2. Add your first test to the `describe` block

```js
it('returns a number if no game rules are met', () => {
	expect(fizzBuzz.check(1)).to.eql(1)
})
```
Run `npm run specs` after to make sure that you have the right setup

----
***Question 2*. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain why we are placing the** 
 ```js
let fizzBuzz = new FizzBuzz
```
**outside the `it` block?**

---

2. Now it's time to add implemenation code.
Create a `src` folder and `js` folder. We also need a `fizz-buzz.js` file to keep our code.

```bash
$ mkdir src
$ mkdir src/js
$ touch src/js/fizz-buzz.js
```

Run `npm run specs` you should get the following error message:
`ReferenceError: FizzBuzz is not defined` make sure that you scroll through the entire output  to find that error message. 

Add the following code to the `fizz-buzz.js` file:
```js
function FizzBuzz()  {
	this.check = (number) => {
		return number:
	}
}
```
Run `npm run specs` you should have the test going green. If it does commit and move on to the next test. 

3.  Add a new it block to fizz-buzz.spec.js
 ```js
 it('returns Fizz if number is divisible by 3', () => {
	expect(fizzBuzz.check(3)).to.eql('Fizz')
})
 ```
 Run `npm run specs` And read the error message
 
Add the following implementation code:
```js
function FizzBuzz() {
	this.check = (number) => {
		if (number % 3 === 0) {
			return 'Fizz';
		} else {
			return number:
		}
	}
}
```
Run `npm run specs` you should have the test going green. If it does commit and move on to the next test. 

----
***Question 3*. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain the difference between using `===` and `==` in JS?** 

---


Lets do the same procedure add the new test
 ```js
 it('returns Buzz if number is divisible by 5', () => {
	expect(fizzBuzz.check(5)).to.eql('Buzz')
})
 ```
  Run `npm run specs` And read the error message

Add the implementation code:

```js
function FizzBuzz() {
	this.check = (number) => {
		if (number % 5 === 0) {
			return 'Buzz';
		} else if (number % 3 === 0) {
			return 'Fizz';
		} else {
			return number
		}
	}
}
```

Run `npm run specs` you should have the test going green. If it does commit and move on to the next test. 


----
***Question 4*. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain why we are moving `(number % 5 === 0)` to the top?** 

---

Now for the last time add the test:
 ```js
 it('returns FizzBuzz if number is divisible by 15', () => {
	expect(fizzBuzz.check(15)).to.eql('FizzBuzz')
})
 ```

  Run `npm run specs` And read the error message

And add the implementation code:

```js
function FizzBuzz() {
	this.check = (number) => {
		if (number % 5 === 0) {
			return 'FizzBuzz';
		} else if (number % 5 === 0) {
			return 'Buzz';
		} else if (number % 3 === 0) {
			return 'Fizz';
		} else {
			return number
		}
	}
}
```

Run `npm run specs` you should have the test going green. If it does commit and lets move to the next section. 


## Feature testing

We are now moving over to feature testing. We should have working logic by now. So let's make sure that we can visably see the results. 

----
***Question 5*. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain the difference between feature and unit test** 

---
1. Create a feature folder and a feature file

```bash
$ mkdir features
$ touch features/index.feature.js
``` 

2. In your `index.feature.js` file add

```js
const { FizzBuzz } = require('../spec/spec.helper')
const BrowserHelpers = require('e2e_training_wheels')
const browser = new BrowserHelpers()
```
to the top of the file

3.  Lets add the descirbe block and the helper methods to the `feature` file.

```js
describe('User can input a value and get FizzBuzz results', () => {
	before(async () => {
		await  browser.init()
		await  browser.visitPage('http://localhost:8080/')
	});

	beforeEach(async () => {
		await  browser.page.reload();
	})

	after(async ()=> {
		await  browser.close();
	})
})
```

Run `npm run test` and make sure that our setup is correct.

Now lets add the `it` block to our `feature.index.js` test

```js
it('clicking on the "Check" button', async () => {
	await browser.fillIn("input[id='value']", { with:  "3" })
	await browser.clickOnButton("input[value='Check']")
	let content = await browser.getContent("[id='display_answer']")
	expect(content).to.eql('Fizz');
})
```
----
***Question 6*. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain what expectations in the context of testing are**

---

Run npm run test, you should get the error message:
```
1) 'clicking on the "Check" button'

[...]

TypeError: Cannot read property 'type' of null
```

Let's fix this

Create a index.html file in the `src` folder

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>FizzBuzz</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

If we go back to our feature test we can see what we need to add to the `index.html` file

We will need:
- A input field for us to enter the number
- A button to start the calculation
- A `<div>` where we can display the result

Lets add those in the `<body>` tag
```html
<input type="text" id="value">
<input type="submit" value="Check" id="button">
<div id="display_answer"></div>
```

In order to call on the connect our javascript code with the DOM elements we need some code to execute that action. Add the following code in the bottom of the file. Just make sure that the scripts are inside the `<html>` tag.

```html
<script src="src/js/fizz-buzz.js"></script>
    <script>
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
            let button = document.getElementById('button')
            let displayDiv = document.getElementById('display_answer')
            button.addEventListener('click', () =>{
                let value = document.getElementById('value').value
                let fizzBuzz = new FizzBuzz
                let result = fizzBuzz.check(value)
                displayDiv.innerHTML = result;
            })
        })
    </script>
```

Run the tests again and make sure that everything is going green.

----
***Question 7*. In your README to the best of your knowledge please write a line to line explanation of what is happening in this code**

```html
<script src="src/js/fizz-buzz.js"></script>
    <script>
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
            let button = document.getElementById('button')
            let displayDiv = document.getElementById('display_answer')
            button.addEventListener('click', () =>{
                let value = document.getElementById('value').value
                let fizzBuzz = new FizzBuzz
                let result = fizzBuzz.check(value)
                displayDiv.innerHTML = result;
            })
        })
    </script>
```

### Styling

Now itÂ´s time to add some styling. Make use of the Tailwind CSS framework to minimally style your application.

You need to add Tailwind through a CDN

Run your test after you have styled the webpage in order to make sure that the code still works.

----
***Question 8*. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain what a CDN (Content Delivery Network) is?**

---

### Deployment

Now it's time to deploy the application.
We will make use of GitHub-pages to do so. However GitHub only recognizes `index.html` that are in the root folder.

This means that we need to modify our configuration of our feature test so we can see that the test are run.

Go to the package.json and remove `src` from the following line:
```js
"features": "superstatic src -p 8080 & mocha --timeout 100000 --recursive  --reporter=spec features PORT=8080 npm run stop-test-server ",
```

run your tests again to make sure that the tests are not failing.

Commit, push and deploy the site.
